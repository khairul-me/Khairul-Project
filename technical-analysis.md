# Technical Implementation and Analysis

## 1. Physical Principles and Sensor Operation

The system's foundation relies on ultrasonic wave physics, where the speed of sound ($v$) varies with temperature according to:

$$v = 331.3\sqrt{\frac{T}{273.15}} \text{ m/s}$$

Distance measurements are derived from time-of-flight principles:

$$d = \frac{v \cdot t}{2}$$

where $d$ is the distance in meters, $t$ is time in seconds, and division by 2 accounts for the round-trip of the ultrasonic pulse.

Environmental factors affecting measurement accuracy are compensated through temperature correction:

$$d_{\text{corrected}} = d_{\text{measured}}(1 + \alpha\Delta T)$$

## 2. Angular Scanning Mechanism

The servo-based scanning system operates under precise angular kinematics:

$$\theta(t) = \theta_0 + \omega t + \frac{1}{2}\alpha t^2$$

where scanning velocity ($\omega$) is controlled to optimize measurement density:

$$\omega = \frac{\Delta\theta}{\Delta t} = \frac{\theta_2 - \theta_1}{t_2 - t_1}$$

## 3. Signal Processing and Noise Reduction

Signal quality is evaluated using Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR):

$$\text{SNR} = 20\log_{10}\left(\frac{A_{\text{signal}}}{A_{\text{noise}}}\right)$$

Initial noise reduction employs a moving average filter:

$$\bar{x}_n = \frac{1}{M}\sum_{i=0}^{M-1} x_{n-i}$$

## 4. Kalman Filter Implementation

The Kalman filter implements a two-stage process:

Prediction Stage:
$$\hat{x}_{k|k-1} = F_k\hat{x}_{k-1|k-1} + B_ku_k$$
$$P_{k|k-1} = F_kP_{k-1|k-1}F_k^T + Q_k$$

Update Stage:
$$K_k = P_{k|k-1}H_k^T(H_kP_{k|k-1}H_k^T + R_k)^{-1}$$
$$\hat{x}_{k|k} = \hat{x}_{k|k-1} + K_k(z_k - H_k\hat{x}_{k|k-1})$$
$$P_{k|k} = (I - K_kH_k)P_{k|k-1}$$

Innovation analysis:
$$\epsilon_k = y_k^TS_k^{-1}y_k$$

where:
- $\hat{x}$ is the state estimate
- $P$ is the error covariance
- $K$ is the Kalman gain
- $F$, $H$ are state transition and measurement matrices
- $Q$, $R$ are process and measurement noise covariances

## 5. Gap Detection and Analysis

Gap geometry is characterized through multiple metrics:

Width Calculation:
$$w = 2d\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)$$

Area Estimation:
$$A = \frac{1}{2}d^2(\theta - \sin\theta)$$

## 6. Statistical Analysis Framework

Measurement uncertainty is quantified using robust statistics:

Standard Deviation:
$$\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N(x_i - \mu)^2}$$

Median Absolute Deviation:
$$\text{MAD} = \text{median}(|X_i - \text{median}(X)|)$$
$$\sigma_{\text{est}} = 1.4826 \cdot \text{MAD}$$

## 7. Adaptive Thresholding System

Dynamic threshold adaptation:
$$T(t) = \mu(t) + k\sigma(t)$$

Exponential moving average:
$$\mu(t) = \alpha x(t) + (1-\alpha)\mu(t-1)$$

where $\alpha$ is the smoothing factor and $k$ is the threshold scaling factor.

## 8. Confidence Scoring Mechanism

Multi-metric confidence score:
$$C = w_tC_t + w_sC_s + w_mC_m$$

Components:
- Temporal confidence: $$C_t = \exp(-\lambda\sigma_t^2)$$
- Spatial confidence: $$C_s = \frac{1}{1 + \alpha|\nabla^2d|}$$
- Measurement confidence derived from baseline deviation

## 9. Error Analysis and Propagation

Total measurement uncertainty:
$$\delta d_{\text{total}} = \sqrt{(\delta d_{\text{sensor}})^2 + (\delta d_{\text{temp}})^2 + (\delta d_{\text{pos}})^2}$$

## 10. Performance Validation Metrics

Precision:
$$P = \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP} + \text{FP}}$$

Recall:
$$R = \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP} + \text{FN}}$$

F1 Score:
$$F1 = \frac{2PR}{P + R}$$

Root Mean Square Error:
$$\text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}$$

Statistical significance (Chi-square test):
$$\chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}$$

This comprehensive mathematical framework ensures robust gap detection and characterization while maintaining system adaptability to varying environmental conditions and measurement scenarios.
