3. **Analysis Layer**

## 3.2 Physical Principles and Sensor Operation
The system's foundation relies on ultrasonic wave physics, where the speed of sound (v) varies with temperature according to:

$$v = 331.3\sqrt{\frac{T}{273.15}} \text{ m/s}$$

Distance measurements are derived from time-of-flight principles:

$$d = \frac{v \cdot t}{2}$$

where d is the distance in meters, t is time in seconds, and division by 2 accounts for the round-trip of the ultrasonic pulse.

## 3.3 Signal Processing Pipeline
### 3.3.1 Kalman Filter Implementation
The Kalman filter implements a two-stage process:

Prediction Stage:
$$\hat{x}_{k|k-1} = F_k\hat{x}_{k-1|k-1} + B_ku_k$$
$$P_{k|k-1} = F_kP_{k-1|k-1}F_k^T + Q_k$$

Update Stage:
$$K_k = P_{k|k-1}H_k^T(H_kP_{k|k-1}H_k^T + R_k)^{-1}$$
$$\hat{x}_{k|k} = \hat{x}_{k|k-1} + K_k(z_k - H_k\hat{x}_{k|k-1})$$
$$P_{k|k} = (I - K_kH_k)P_{k|k-1}$$

### 3.3.2 Dynamic Thresholding System
The system employs adaptive thresholding:

$$T(t) = \mu(t) + k\sigma(t)$$

Exponential moving average:
$$\mu(t) = \alpha x(t) + (1-\alpha)\mu(t-1)$$

where α is the smoothing factor and k is the threshold scaling factor.

## 3.4 Machine Learning Integration
### 3.4.1 DBSCAN Clustering
```python
eps = 0.3 * np.std(X_scaled)
dbscan = DBSCAN(eps=eps, min_samples=3)
labels = dbscan.fit_predict(X_scaled)
```

### 3.4.2 Isolation Forest Implementation
```python
isolation_forest = IsolationForest(
    contamination=0.1,
    random_state=42,
    n_estimators=100
)
```

## 3.5 Confidence Scoring System
Multi-metric confidence score calculation:

$$C = w_tC_t + w_sC_s + w_mC_m$$

Where:
- Temporal confidence: $$C_t = \exp(-\lambda\sigma_t^2)$$
- Spatial confidence: $$C_s = \frac{1}{1+\alpha|\nabla^2d|}$$
- Measurement confidence derived from baseline deviation

## 3.7 Error Analysis and Propagation
Total measurement uncertainty:

$$\delta d_{total} = \sqrt{(\delta d_{sensor})^2 + (\delta d_{temp})^2 + (\delta d_{pos})^2}$$

## 3.8 Validation Metrics
Root Mean Square Error:
$$RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\hat{y_i})^2}$$

Statistical significance (Chi-square test):
$$\chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n\frac{(O_i-E_i)^2}{E_i}$$
